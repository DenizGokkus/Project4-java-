Development of a Real-Time Document Collaboration System in Java

Description:

We are looking to develop a sophisticated real-time collaborative editing system, similar to Google Docs, using Java's core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This system will allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously and see each other's changes in real-time. This project will focus on the backend architecture, utilizing core Java features without relying on external libraries for the core logic.

Objective:

The primary goal is to design and implement a robust system that handles concurrent document editing efficiently and reliably, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates across all clients.

Key Features:

Real-Time Editing:
Multiple users should be able to edit the document simultaneously.
Changes made by one user should be visible to all other users immediately.

Operational Transformation (OT):
Implement an algorithm to manage concurrent operations without conflicts.
The system should resolve conflicts and merge changes intelligently.

User Session Management:
Efficiently handle user sessions and connections.
Track active users and manage user disconnections/reconnections smoothly.

Change History:
Maintain a version history of all changes.
Allow users to view previous versions and roll back to them if necessary.

Text-Based Document Support:
Initially, the system should support plain text editing.
Consider the structure for future support of rich text and other formats.
